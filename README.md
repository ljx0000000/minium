Initialization:
-------------------------------
A dp array is created to store the minimum path sums. It has the same dimensions as the input grid.
The first cell of dp is initialized to the value of the first cell of the grid.
First Row and First Column:

The first row is filled by accumulating the values from left to right.
The first column is filled by accumulating the values from top to bottom.
Dynamic Programming Transition:

For each cell (i, j), the value dp[i][j] is calculated as the minimum of the values from the cell above (dp[i-1][j]) and the cell to the left (dp[i][j-1]), plus the value of the current cell grid[i][j].

Result:
-------------------------------------
The value at the bottom-right cell dp[m-1][n-1] contains the minimum path sum from the top-left to the bottom-right corner of the grid.
You can use this code by calling the minPathSum function with your grid as input to get the minimum path sum.
The provided code correctly calculates the minimum path sum in a grid from the top-left to the bottom-right cell. Let's walk through the logic step by step to ensure everything is clear:

Initial Checks: The code first checks if the input grid is empty or if the first row is empty. If either is true, it returns 0 since there would be no path to calculate.
Initialization: The dimensions m (number of rows) and n (number of columns) of the grid are determined. A 2D list dp with the same dimensions is created to store the minimum path sums up to each cell.
First Cell Initialization: The starting point dp[0][0] is initialized with the value of grid[0][0].
First Row Initialization: The first row of the dp table is filled in by accumulating the values from the left. Each cell dp[0][j] is the sum of the cell to its left dp[0][j-1] and the current cell in the grid grid[0][j].
First Column Initialization: Similarly, the first column of the dp table is filled by accumulating the values from above. Each cell dp[i][0] is the sum of the cell above it dp[i-1][0] and the current cell in the grid grid[i][0].
Filling the Rest of the DP Table: For each remaining cell in the grid, the code computes the minimum path sum to reach that cell by taking the minimum of the path sums from the cell directly above (dp[i-1][j]) or from the cell to the left (dp[i][j-1]), and adding the current cell's value grid[i][j].
Result: The bottom-right cell of the dp table dp[m-1][n-1] contains the minimum path sum from the top-left to the bottom-right cell.
